# soundbed

An ambient audio generator.

Use SoundBed to generate audio for animation, simulations or general ambient effects in a web browser. The module uses the [Web Audo API](http://webaudio.github.io/web-audio-api/) and by default will generate a low, rumbling hum that naturally varies in frequency. Use the options below for different configurations. Your browser [must support](http://caniuse.com/#feat=audio-api) the Web Audio API.

##Install

To include soundbed as a component in your project, use the node module.

```
npm install soundbed --save
```

You can also use the [standalone version](https://github.com/vinceallenvince/soundbed/releases/latest) and reference the js file from your document.

```
<html>
  <head>
    <script src="scripts/soundbed.min.js" type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8"></script>
  </head>
  ...
```

##Usage

The module exports a SoundBed class. In a nodejs project, you create a player via:

```
var SoundBed = require('../src/soundbed');
var player = new SoundBed.Player();
```

In the browser, the SoundBed namespace is exposed.

```
<html>
  <head>
    <script src="scripts/soundbed.min.js" type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <script>
      var player = new SoundBed.Player();
      player.init({
        oscAFreq: 60,
        oscBFreq: 120,
        oscARate: 0.01,
        oscBRate: -0.01,
        freqMin: 60,
        freqMax: 120,
        volumeMin: 0.1,
        volumeMax: 1
      });
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

##Configure

By default, a SoundBed player creates two Web Audio [Oscillator](http://webaudio.github.io/web-audio-api/#the-oscillatornode-interface) nodes and cycles their frequencies in opposite directions inside an [RequestAnimationFrame](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/window.requestAnimationFrame) loop. In each frame the player maps [Perlin noise](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perlin_noise) to a minimum/maximum range to determine the frequency. It also cycles the overall volume using the Perlin values.

You can pass the following options when initializing a Player.

 *    *perlin* (default = true)

      When set to true, the oscillators' frequencies cycle via Perlin noise.

 *    *reverb*

      Reverb level. Valid values are 0 - 5 and map to the following:

      0 = none

      1 = inverse

      2 = small

      3 = medium

      4 = large

      5 = huge


 *    *delayTime* (default = 0)

      Delay time.

 *    *oscAFreq* (default = 150)

      Oscillator A's initial frequency.

 *    *oscBFreq* (default = 200)

      Oscillator B's initial frequency.

 *    *oscARate* (default = 0.001)

      Oscillator A's cycle rate through its frequency min/max.

 *    *oscBRate* (default = -0.001)

      Oscillator B's cycle rate through its frequency min/max.

 *    *freqMin* (default = 150)

      Both oscillators' minimum frequency.

 *    *freqMax* (default = 200)

      Both oscillators' maximum frequency.

 *    *volume* (default = 0.25)

      The player's initial volume. Valid values between 0 and 1.

 *    *volumeMin* (default = 0.1)

      The player's minimum volume. Valid values between 0 and 1.

 *    *volumeMax* (default = 0.25)

      The player's maximum volume. Valid values between 0 and 1.

 *    *beforeStep* (default = function() {})

      A function called at the beginning of each animation frame.

##Building this project

This project uses [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com). To build the project first install the node modules.

```
npm install
```

Next, run grunt.

```
grunt
```

To run the tests, run 'npm test'.

```
npm test
```

To check test coverage run 'grunt coverage'.

```
grunt coverage
```

A pre-commit hook is defined in /pre-commit that runs jshint. To use the hook, run the following:

```
ln -s ../../pre-commit .git/hooks/pre-commit
```

A post-commit hook is defined in /post-commit that runs the Plato complexity analysis tools. To use the hook, run the following:

```
ln -s ../../post-commit .git/hooks/post-commit
```
